## Experiments

A variety of crates that experiment with different aspects of the Rust ecosystem.

These experiments are not necessarily associated with the contents of the [lib-wc](../) library.

### Some of the cool ones

1. [kvs](./kvs/) - a key-value store (File System I/O, Networking I/O, Tokio, Serialization)
